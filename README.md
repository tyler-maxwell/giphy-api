# giphy-api

## Purpose
This is a class project to demonstrate my skills with using API's. 

## Overview
This repository utilizes the Giphy API to search for gifs by clicking on the buttons along the header. Each button represents one topic that will be searched. Clicking on a button additional times in sequence will display additional gifs for that topic. Additional topic buttons can be added by using the form on the right side of the page. Gifs are displayed as still images with metadata displayed beneath them. Clicking an image will animate and/or stop the gif. Gifs can also be favorited and their giphy id's will be stored locally. Clicking the favorites button on the right side of the screen will display all currently favorited gifs, where individual gifs can also be removed from the list of favorites.
